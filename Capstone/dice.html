            <p id="intro">Here are the rules, simple enough that even you can understand them: we take turns rolling dice. The
                totals of our dice rolls add to our grand total, and the first to 100 points wins. Each time a player
                rolls, the other player has a chance to first bet odd or even, earning themselves 5 points for the turn
                if successful. Roll snake eyes, and you get to roll again.</p>
